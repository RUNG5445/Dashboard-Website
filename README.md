# Dashboard Website for Monitoring Humidity, Temperature, and Container Location using Django

This project aims to develop a comprehensive dashboard website that enables real-time monitoring of humidity, temperature, and the position of containers. The dashboard will be built using the Django framework, which provides a robust and scalable foundation for web development.

The primary goal of the dashboard is to provide users with an intuitive and user-friendly interface to track crucial data related to container management. The website will offer a centralized platform to monitor and analyze the environmental conditions and location of containers, ensuring optimal storage and transportation conditions.

## Key Features:

1. Real-time Data Monitoring: The dashboard will display real-time humidity and temperature readings as well as the current position of containers. Users can access this information at any time to ensure that the containers are within the desired environmental parameters.

2. Historical Data Analysis: The website will store and present historical data, allowing users to analyze trends, identify patterns, and make informed decisions. Graphical representations and data visualizations will provide insights into temperature and humidity variations over time.

3. Container Tracking: The website will utilize GPS or other positioning technologies to track container locations. Users will be able to view the current position of containers on a map within the dashboard.

4. Responsive Design: The dashboard will be designed to be responsive, ensuring seamless accessibility across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

By implementing this project, container management processes will be significantly enhanced, promoting efficiency, reducing losses due to unfavorable environmental conditions, and facilitating better decision-making. The use of Django as the development framework ensures a scalable, secure, and maintainable solution.
